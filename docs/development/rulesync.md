# rulesync operations

[rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync) manages AI tool settings from `.rulesync/`.

## Deviation from aidd-template-lean

[aidd-template-lean](https://github.com/kyto64/aidd-template-lean) generates multiple rulesync targets (`cursor`, `claudecode`, `codexcli`, `agentsskills`). **This repository is Devin-only** and configures just two targets in `rulesync.jsonc`:

| Target | Features | Committed outputs |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| `agentsmd` | `rules` | `AGENTS.md` (root, single self-contained file) |
| `agentsskills` | `skills` | `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` |

Other differences from the template:

- **All rules are `root: true`**, so every rule is inlined into `AGENTS.md` (no TOON index, no `.agents/memories/`). `AGENTS.md` must stay **under 16 KiB**; setup and quality gates are kept near the top.
- No `cursor:` frontmatter in `.rulesync/rules/*.md`; no `.cursor/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, or `.codex/` outputs.
- `.rulesync/mcp.json` and `.rulesync/permissions.json` are **kept but unused** (no target consumes `mcp` or `permissions`).

## SSOT layout

```
.rulesync/
├── rules/           # Project rules (all root: true; incl. CLAUDE.md overview)
├── skills/          # Agent skills → .agents/skills/
├── apply-devin-frontmatter.mjs # Copies Devin-specific skill fields from SSOT
├── mcp.json         # Project MCP (empty; unused)
└── permissions.json # Permissions (unused)
rulesync.jsonc       # Generator config (agentsmd + agentsskills only)
```

## Workflow

1. Edit `.rulesync/rules/` or `.rulesync/skills/` (and `rulesync.jsonc` if needed).
2. Run `npm run rules:generate`.
3. Commit `.rulesync/`, `rulesync.jsonc`, **`AGENTS.md`**, and **`.agents/skills/`** when outputs change.

### Devin skill frontmatter

rulesync 33.0.0's `agentsskills` target does not export Devin's `triggers` or the root-level `allowed-tools` field. Keep Devin-specific fields in each SSOT skill's `devin:` block. `npm run rules:generate` runs rulesync, then `.rulesync/apply-devin-frontmatter.mjs` merges that block into the generated frontmatter without changing the skill body. Do not edit generated skills by hand or use bare `rulesync generate` as the complete generation command.

- `start-ticket`, `close-ticket`, and `address-pr-feedback`: `devin.triggers: ["user"]` prevents automatic invocation.
- `spec-lookup`: `devin.allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]` preserves read-only access.

The adapter reads YAML with the direct dev dependency `js-yaml`; CI uses the same npm command as local generation. These fields follow [Devin Skills](https://docs.devin.ai/product-guides/skills).

## After clone

```bash
npm ci
```

`AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/` are already in git for Devin. Regenerate only after SSOT edits.

## CI

`.github/workflows/check_rulesync.yaml` on every PR:

1. `npm ci`, then `npm run rules:generate` (rulesync 33.0.0 + Devin frontmatter adapter)
2. `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all -- AGENTS.md .agents/`
3. Fail if that output is non-empty (catches modified, deleted, and new/stale untracked outputs)

Local equivalent after `npm run rules:generate`:

```bash
test -z "$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all -- AGENTS.md .agents/)"
```

## Devin

Devin reads the root **`AGENTS.md`** and **`.agents/skills/`** from the repository; both are committed. The Devin environment (Node 24, xvfb, VS Code test libraries, `npm ci`, lint/build/test commands) is defined in [`.devin/blueprint.yaml`](../../.devin/blueprint.yaml).

After a change to `.devin/blueprint.yaml` is merged to `master`, run a **manual Sync** of this repository's blueprint in the Devin UI (environment settings) so the next snapshot build picks it up; merging alone does not apply it.

## Version pin

```bash
npm run rules:generate   # npx rulesync@33.0.0
```

The version is pinned exactly (no range) in `package.json`; `check_rulesync.yaml` runs that same npm script rather than maintaining a second version pin. 33.0.0 is kept even though it is very recent: rulesync ships a new major almost daily (28.0.0–33.0.0 were all released 2026-10-08 to 2026-10-12), so no older major has meaningfully more soak time, and 33.0.0 was verified to produce the committed outputs. The exact pin plus the CI drift check keeps generation reproducible; bump deliberately and regenerate in the same PR.
